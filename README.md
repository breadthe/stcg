A Trading Card Game concept partially modeled after [TCG Card Shop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/).


## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`)

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
